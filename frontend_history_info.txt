FRONTEND HISTORY SECTION
========================

YES, there is a history section in the frontend, typically referred to as "Reports".

1. Component Name
   --------------
   Likely `Reports.jsx` (based on previous development context).

2. Functionality
   -------------
   - It displays the list of past visits.
   - It should be fetching data from the backend endpoint: `GET /api/admin/history`.
   - It typically shows columns like:
     - Visitor Name
     - Host
     - Company
     - Status (APPROVED, REJECTED, CHECKED_IN, CHECKED_OUT)
     - Time/Date

3. Integration
   -----------
   - Ensure this component calls the `getHistory` API.
   - It serves as the read-only view for all past and current visit records.
