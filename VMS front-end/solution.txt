ANALYSIS AND SOLUTION

The issue is NOT in the frontend. The frontend correctly sends a request to approve/check-in ONLY the specific visitor you clicked (e.g., "nayan").

The fact that "Akash Nilkund" appears with the **exact same timestamp** (e.g., 11:29 PM) as the new visitor strongly indicates a **Backend Logic Issue**.

**DIAGNOSIS:**
It is highly likely that your Backend Code (Spring Boot) has one of the following issues:

1.  **Hardcoded "Demo" Logic:**
    There might be code in your `VisitorService.java` or `VisitorController.java` that automatically checks in a test user ("Akash Nilkund") whenever *any* visitor is checked in. This is often done during development to populate the dashboard and forgotten.

2.  **"Approve All" Bug:**
    The API endpoint for approval might be accidentally fetching *all* pending (or history) records and checking them in, instead of just the one matching the `id`.

3.  **Database Trigger:**
    Less likely, but there could be a database trigger creating this record.

**SOLUTION (Check your Backend Code):**

1.  Open `src/main/java/com/vms/backend/service/VisitorService.java` (or similar).
2.  Find the `approveVisitor` and `checkInVisitor` methods.
3.  **Look for any code that creates a new Visitor object or saves a hardcoded name like "Akash Nilkund".**
4.  **Look for loops:** Ensure the code only acts on the `visitorRepository.findById(id)`, and does NOT do `visitorRepository.findAll()`.

**Example of BAD Code to look for:**
```java
public void checkInVisitor(Long id) {
    // ... logic for id ...
    
    // BAD: This creates a ghost visitor every time!
    createDummyVisitor("Akash Nilkund"); 
}
```

**Frontend Verification:**
The frontend code in `PendingApprovalsTable.jsx` is clean:
```javascript
await visitorService.approveVisitor(id);
await visitorService.checkInVisitor(id);
```
It strictly acts on the `id` of the row you clicked. It cannot magically add "Akash Nilkund" unless the backend does it.
