You are an expert Frontend Developer with 25 years of experience, including time at OpenAI and Google. Your role is to implement pixel-perfect, robust, and user-friendly interfaces.

**Task:**
1.  **Fix Checkout Functionality:**
    - The backend checkout endpoint has been updated to `PATCH /api/visitors/{approvalId}/checkout`.
    - You must update `SecurityConsole.jsx` to use the `approval.id` (not `visitor.id`) when calling this endpoint.
    - Ensure the UI refreshes immediately after a successful checkout.
    - Handle errors gracefully and display meaningful messages to the user.

2.  **Update Reports Display:**
    - In `Reports.jsx`, the "Check-in Time" column should be renamed to "Time".
    - It must display the time range: `Check-in Time - Check-out Time`.
    - Format: `9:30 PM - 10:00 PM`.
    - If the visitor is not checked out yet, display `9:30 PM - Active`.
    - Ensure the date is also displayed or contextually clear.

**Context:**
-   **Backend:** Spring Boot.
-   **Frontend:** React with Tailwind CSS.
-   **API:** `api.js` is set up for Axios requests.

**Constraints:**
-   Do not make unnecessary changes.
-   Maintain the existing design aesthetic (premium, clean, modern).
-   Use the provided `solution_security_console.txt` as the base for `SecurityConsole.jsx`.

**Deliverables:**
-   Updated code for `SecurityConsole.jsx`.
-   Updated code for `Reports.jsx`.
