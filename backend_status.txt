NO

Explanation:
You do NOT need to make any further changes to the backend code. The connection is already fully implemented.

Here is what has been done:
1.  **Entity (`Host.java`)**: The `@ManyToOne` relationship is added, so the backend knows that a Host belongs to a Company.
2.  **DTO (`HostDTO.java`)**: The `companyId` field is added to carry this information to the frontend.
3.  **Service (`HostService.java`)**: The logic to extract the ID (`host.getCompany().getId()`) and put it into the DTO is written.
4.  **Controller (`HostController.java`)**: The API endpoint is updated to return this new structure.

The backend is ready. If you don't see the connection in the app, it is likely because the **Database Data** is missing (i.e., the `company_id` column in your `host` table is NULL for those rows). You just need to update your database records.
